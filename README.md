# Makefile Utils

This is just a couple of files that I find very useful to have around my projects.

You can copy them into your projects as I usually do, by creating a `utils/` folder on your project and copying those files over.

Then you can use the `makefile` file on this repo as an example on how to includ them and how they can be used.

Please feel free to add issues for requests or PRs if you see anything that can be fixed or added.
